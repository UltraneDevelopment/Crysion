# Notes for v1.2.5

# Next Updates To Do (Quick Notes)

- Reinstate default theme application and preferences
- Update the new buttons that were added
- Give the new buttons actual purpose / function
- Chnage the style and layout of the sidebar buttons

# Next Updates To Do (In Detail)

- It appears as thought in Update v1.2.3 some code was removed which helps to automatically asign the user preferences for themes.
    This needs to be tested thoroughly and if required, the code should be reinstated.
- The new buttons  currently do not have valid IDs and therefore, also cannot be given a function. This needs to be 
    updated with all buttons having relevant functions such as page redirections, force quit .etc.
- The current style of the sidebar is not optimal, and does not suit the current design factor. However, it must be taken into 
    consideration that the sidebar was not developed with a design visible. No design has been done for the sidebar so this will simply be a 
    process of trial and error
